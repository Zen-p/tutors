# 🚀 DevOps & Java Knowledge Base

> "Chaos is the enemy of any system. Structure is the foundation of architecture."

## 👋 About
Hi, I'm Evgeny. I am an aspiring **DevOps Engineer** on my way to mastering high-load systems architecture.

During my learning journey, I realized that information without structure is useless noise. I processed gigabytes of documentation, courses, and articles on **Java, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD** and distilled them into this repository.

This is not just a "dump" of links. These are structured, clean **.md notes** that I use as my personal "Second Brain". Now, they are open for you.

## 📚 Contents
The repository is organized by technology stack:

- **☕ Java Core:** Collections, Multithreading, Streams API, JVM internals.
- **🐳 Docker:** Images, Containers, Networks, Multistage builds, Best practices.
- **☸️ Kubernetes:** Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps (Basic to Advanced).
- **🛠 CI/CD:** Pipelines, GitHub Actions, principles of automation.
- **Linux & Git:** Essential commands and workflows.

## 🎯 Goal
My goal is to build a solid foundation for future architectural decisions. I believe that a deep understanding of the basics is what distinguishes an **Engineer** from a user.

## 🚀 How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in **Obsidian**, **Notion**, or **VS Code**.
3. Use it as a cheat sheet or a learning roadmap.
